# Text-Vector
This Python code snippet, demonstrates converting text to vectors using TF-IDF  and calculating cosine similarity. It utilizes TfidfVectorizer from sklearn.feature_extraction.text and cosine_similarity from sklearn.metrics.pairwise to determine the closeness between two text samples. TF-IDF and pure TF approaches are shown
